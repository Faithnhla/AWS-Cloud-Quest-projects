# Problem statement:
The surf shop wants a cost estimate for scalable cloud architecture to support their online store.

# Solution Request:
Create a cost estimate for a scalable Amazon EC2 architecture that can handle varying levels of demand, including peak usage periods.

# Project Summary:
This project demonstrates how to use AWS pricing tools to estimate the cost of running a scalable Amazon EC2 architecture. It includes creating logical pricing groups, estimating EC2 usage based on demand patterns
, adjusting instance types to optimize cost, and generating a shareable pricing estimate link. The goal is to understand cloud economics and evaluate cost-effective infrastructure decisions without upfront capital
expenses.

# Services used:
AWS Pricing Calculator
• Created logical pricing groups
• Generated an Amazon EC2 cost estimate
• Adjusted instance types to compare pricing scenarios
• Generated a shareable estimate link

Amazon EC2
• Estimated compute usage based on projected demand
• Modified instance type to t2.micro for cost comparison

# In this lab, I completed the following tasks:
• Created logical pricing groups to organize infrastructure components.
• Built a cost estimate for projected Amazon EC2 usage based on demand.
• Evaluated pricing for scalable architecture to support peak traffic.
• Changed the EC2 instance type to t2.micro within the estimate to compare costs.
• Generated and reviewed a new shareable price estimate link.
