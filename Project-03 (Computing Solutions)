#Problem statement:
The school wants to upgrade its class scheduling system, currently running on an Amazon EC2 instance, to provide greater computing power and memory capacity.

#Solution Request:
Scale up the existing Amazon EC2 instance by selecting a larger instance type to enhance the application's performance.

# Project Summary:
This project demonstrates how to vertically scale an Amazon EC2 instance to improve application performance. It includes exploring EC2 instance types, filtering instances based on performance attributes, 
connecting securely to the instance, reviewing instance metadata, and stopping and starting the instance to apply a larger general-purpose instance type (m4.large).

#Services used:
Amazon EC2
• Explored and compared EC2 instance types
• Filtered instance types based on compute and memory attributes
• Changed the instance type to a larger general-purpose instance (m4.large)
• Started and stopped the EC2 instance using the console

EC2 Instance Connect
• Connected securely to the EC2 instance through the browser

Instance Metadata Service
• Viewed EC2 instance metadata using the instance’s public IP address

#In this lab, I completed the following tasks:
• Explored available Amazon EC2 instance types and their specifications.
• Filtered EC2 instance types based on required compute and memory attributes.
• Connected to the EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect.
• Viewed instance metadata through the public IP address in a web browser.
• Stopped the EC2 instance to prepare for resizing.
• Changed the instance type to m4.large.
• Restarted the EC2 instance and verified improved performance capacity.
