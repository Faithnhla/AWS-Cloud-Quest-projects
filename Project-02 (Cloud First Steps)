# Problem statement:
The island stabilization team wants to increase the reliability and availability of its current stabilization system.

#Solution Request:
Deploy the stabilization system across two Amazon EC2 instances in separate Availability Zones within the same AWS Region.

#Project Summary:
This project demonstrates how to improve system reliability and availability by launching Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones. It includes configuring a user data script to automatically 
display instance details in a browser and expanding the deployment to ensure high availability through redundancy across zones.

#Services used:
Amazon EC2
• Launched virtual server instances
• Configured user data scripts for automated instance setup
• Deployed instances across multiple Availability Zones to improve availability

#In this lab, I completed the following tasks:
• Launched an Amazon EC2 instance.
• Configured a user data script to display instance details in a web browser.
• Launched a second EC2 instance in a different Availability Zone within the same AWS Region.
• Verified that both instances were running to support higher availability of the stabilization system.
