## AWS Cloud Quest: Recertify Cloud Practitioner (13 Projects)

This repository contains all 13 hands-on projects I completed as part of **AWS Cloud Quest: Recertify Cloud Practitioner**.  
The course bridged the gap between my theoretical knowledge and real-world application by providing practical, scenario-based challenges.  
Each assignment simulated real business problems and strengthened my cloud architecture, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills using core AWS services.
