# Problem statement:
The insurance company wants to help its database administrators spend less time on operational tasks, such as patching and managing database infrastructure. They also want a solution that improves database 
availability and efficiency.

# Solution Request:
Migrate to Amazon RDS to automate routine database administration tasks while implementing Multi-AZ deployment and a read replica to provide high availability and improved performance.

# Project Summary:
This project demonstrates how to modernize database infrastructure by migrating to Amazon RDS. It focuses on reducing administrative overhead through managed services, improving availability with Multi-AZ 
deployment, enabling automated backups, and enhancing performance by creating a read replica. The solution increases reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency for the organization.

# Services used:
Amazon RDS
• Launched a managed relational database instance
• Configured Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
• Enabled automated backups
• Created a read replica to improve read performance and scalability

AWS Database Services
• Explored AWS managed database offerings to evaluate suitable solutions

# In this lab, I completed the following tasks:
• Explored AWS database service options.
• Launched an Amazon RDS instance for the application database.
• Configured Multi-AZ deployment to improve availability and fault tolerance.
• Enabled and reviewed automated backup settings.
• Created a read replica of the primary database using a db.t3.xlarge instance to enhance performance and scalability.
